## Description 
Are you having trouble sticking to your New Year’s Resolution to get in shape?  With HealthyCompetition, you are placed i a community of like-minded people and compete over time to see who is the fittest in your group.  

HealthyCompetition is an easy-to-navigate workout tracker that allows the user to simply mark whether or not a workout has been completed that day and compare the number of days they worked out to others on the application. We developed an application that builds a sense of community and accountability when it comes to working out. We cut the fuss out of other workout applications with our beautiful and  intuitive interface. 

User Story:
AS A competitive person trying to consistently workout

## Installation
Clone the repo, install all the npm packages, run in the browser.  


## Usage 
If you do not already have an account, register with your email and a password.  Once you either login or register, you will view your dashboard.  If today is an active day, click yes to create your workout.  If it is a rest day, click no.  You can also view your stats directly from this page.  Once your workout is complete, click "workout complete" and watch the clock transform into a flexed arm.  This will create your `Today's Workout` and `Streak`.  Your streak counts the consecutive number of workout days.  You can click `See How You Stack Up` or `Back to Team Page` from the Workout page to view your team's streaks and workout for the day.  This is where you can leave a message for a team member on the message board. You may logout if you wish, or stay logged in and close your browser or app.
